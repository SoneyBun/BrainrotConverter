A fun and playful text-editing tool called BrainrotConverter turns common words into the oddball exaggerated style we like to refer to as brainrot. Simple but humorous the idea is that the converter recognizes each words final vowel and adds the suffix uzz to it giving your sentences a disorganized almost meme-like appearance.
